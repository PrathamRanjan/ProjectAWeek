## Week 1: AI Automated PowerBI Analysis Tool
This week’s project automates business analysis of PowerBI dashboards using GROQ’s SmolVLM (vision model) and Llama 3 (text model), and then generates a powerpoint slideshow with the analysis. 

### 🔍 What It Does

- 📸 Takes a screenshot of any public PowerBI dashboard
- 👁️ Uses **SmolVLM** to extract all visible data (KPIs, charts, filters)
- 🤖 Uses **Llama 3** to generate a detailed business analysis
- 📄 Generates a polished PowerPoint report

### Improvements

Look into utilizing the PowerBI API for more accurate data, and further scalability, this is a good prototype
